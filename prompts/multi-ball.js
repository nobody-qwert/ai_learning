    prompt: `make an html for 10 bounccing red balls within a triangle
make sure to handle collision detection properly betweend balls and also between walls of the triangle. 
make the triangle slowly rotate. 
allow user to move and shake the triangle with the mouse while it rotates.
make sure ball stays within the triangle.
implement it in a single html file.`
